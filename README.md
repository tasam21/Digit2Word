Conversion of amount in number to word format using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 

When writing a check, you need to write out the amount using words (in addition to the numerals in the dollar box). This helps to prevent confusion and fraud – numerals can easily be altered or misunderstood, but an amount in words is much more difficult to tamper with. In most cases, it doesn’t matter what you write or how you write it: nobody will notice unless there’s a problem with the check.

The amount you write using words is the official amount of your check. If the amount in numeric format differs from what you wrote in word format, the bank is supposed to go with the amount written out in words – this is the legal amount of your payment.

In most cases, nobody even reads the amount that you write with words. Checks with discrepancies often go unnoticed, especially when deposited at ATMs, but somebody will notice if there’s a problem with your check.

People commonly make mistake when using writing amount in number to word format so to make them easy to write the amount in word format, I would like to share this piece of software. Hope you like it.
